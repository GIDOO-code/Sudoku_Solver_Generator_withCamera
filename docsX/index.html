            <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><br>

			This HP will explain more than 50 Sudoku algorithms. Several 
			elementary algorithms are helpful for humans to solve with pencils 
			and intelligence alone. Advanced algorithms are for programs.<br>
			i think, this problem is extremely difficult for humans to solve.
			 It would be better not to try. This is a problem handled by the program.</p>

            <p> 
                The rule "Insert digit 1-9 for each row/column/block" is the 
				same as Sudoku. Contradiction as a solution method is prohibited. 
				Because Sudoku is a puzzle, it is trivial to be able to solve 
				any problem. This site deal with logically the algorithm to 
				explain truth or false. This is a local rule. i am aware that 
				there are different opinions.<br><br>
				The solution of Sudoku(digit array) on the upper is as shown. 
				But that is not a solution to the rules here. A logical 
				explanation for solving a solution is necessary.</p>

            <h3><strong>Next...</strong></h3>
            <p> This site is Sudoku analysis algorithm and C# program example.
                If you understand these and complement your own code, you can assemble a program to solve Sudoku.
                The best is to make your own code by referring to the example program.
                The example program is used in GNPX, 
                but it is (often) changed by bug fix, improvement, or just a mood.
                It would be better to develop your own algorithms and to incorporate them. <br>
                As for making Sudoku's problem, i will not explain directly. 
                Just combine Latin squares and analysis algorithms.<br>
                Win application <strong>GNPX</strong> and <strong>VisualStudio project(C#)</strong> can be downloaded.<br>
				GNPX has been updated to <span class="auto-style1">V3.10. </span>
			The camera function will be another system.</P>
